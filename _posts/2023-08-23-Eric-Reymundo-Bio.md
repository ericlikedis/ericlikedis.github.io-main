## Welcome!

Hey there, I'm Eric Reymundo, and I'm thrilled to share a glimpse of my journey with you. I currently work as a Junior Cloud Security Engineer, specializing in Detection Engineering. But how did I end up here, you might wonder? Let me take you back to where it all began.

At 16, I kicked off my career by cutting grass and earning paper checks. It was a humble start that instilled in me the value of hard work and perseverance. After finishing high school, I decided to make a change and enrolled in community college around fall 2014. My sights were set on Graphic Design, and I was excited to embark on this new chapter.

However, my journey was far from smooth. Over the span of five years, I chipped away at an Associates of Arts degree. There were times when I faced academic challenges, even flunking a few classes that resulted in the loss of financial aid. But setbacks couldn't deter my determination. I bounced back, got my grades back on track, and regained access to financial aid.

My community college experience was a rollercoaster ride, filled with ups and downs. The road to success is anything but linear, and I learned that firsthand. Near the end of my journey, I made a switch and completed my basics with an Associates of Science.

It took me from Fall 2014 to Spring 2019 to fully complete my two-year Associates degree. The journey was transformative, and I went through many changes during that time.

Later on, I decided to take a step further and enrolled at UNT Dallas. However, life had its challenges. Balancing coursework with making ends meet and supporting my family proved to be tough. Despite my best intentions, I found it difficult to keep up with classes and attendance. Ultimately, I made the difficult decision to drop out.

But this setback only fueled my determination to find my true calling. I started researching degrees offered by UNT and began to see a path that aligned with my evolving interests and aspirations.

After my time at UNT Dallas, I switched gears and enrolled in UNT Online, pursuing a BSIS. In Fall 2020, a fortune 500 company offered me an internship that paved the way for a job offer upon graduation. Balancing work and preparing for my future, I even worked at a coffee shop in between. Graduating in Summer 2022, I stepped into the role of a Junior Cloud Security Engineer at the same fortune 500 company. 

My journey from starting from the ground grass cutting to soaring the skies with Cloud Security Engineering has been a series of twists and turns, lessons learned, and moments of resilience. I'm excited to continue this adventure, embracing every challenge and opportunity that comes my way. Stay tuned for more updates as I explore the world of cloud security and pursue my passion.

Thanks for joining me on this ride!
