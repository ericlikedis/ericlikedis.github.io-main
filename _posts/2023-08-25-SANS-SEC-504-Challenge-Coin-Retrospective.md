Over the summer I had the opportunity to take the SANS SEC 504 course taught by Mick Douglas (amazing instructor by the way) in the 6 long days in the course I would learn these five concepts and run labs that are more hands on to help with seeing how these concepts work from a Defender standpoint but also the Attacker standpoint: 

### Incident Response and Cyber Investigations
In this section of the course we covered a variety of topics such as, Incident Response, Digital Investigations, Live Examination, Network Investigations, Memory Investigations, Malware Investigations, and Cloud Investigations. 

Paired with 5 Live Exercises going over the following in order respectively: 

- Live Windows examination
- Network investigation
- Memory investigation
- Malware investigation
- Cloud investigation

### Recon, Scanning, and Enumeration Attacks
